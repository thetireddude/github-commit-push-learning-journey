hello

i just learned how to change the default branch name from master to main
I am not sure why it named my main branch master since all git versions after 2.28 should name their default branch main 

i renamed the master branch of my local repo to main

i couldn't see my changes after i pushed for the second time because I now had two branches in my GitHub repo --> master and main
so, i tried to delete master from the remote repo. But, it wouldn't let me because master was still the default branch for my remote GitHub repo 
Therefore, I learned to switch my GitHub default branch 

On second thoughts, I have decided to maintain this repo, as a personal journal of sorts, to keep track of all issues I encountered while learning how to commit and push files from a local to a my remote repo
